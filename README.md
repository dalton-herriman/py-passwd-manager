- üíª **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for power users
- üñ•Ô∏è **GUI Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface
- üóÇÔ∏è **Multiple Vaults**: Create and manage multiple disconnected vaults
- üîç **Search & Filter**: Find passwords quickly with search functionality
- üìã **Clipboard Support**: Easy copy-paste functionality
- üîÑ **Import/Export**: Support for multiple formats
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**: Password strength validation, secure memory wiping
- üìä **Statistics**: Vault usage statistics and insights

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd py-passwd-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # CLI version
   python -m cli.multi_vault_cli
   
   # GUI version
   python -m gui.app
   ```

## Windows Users

For Windows users, we provide convenient alternatives to the Makefile:

### PowerShell Script (Recommended)

Use the `run.ps1` script for the most features:

```powershell
# Show all available commands
.\run.ps1 help

# Quick start with validation
.\run.ps1 quick-start

# Run the GUI
.\run.ps1 gui

# Run the CLI
.\run.ps1 cli

# Run tests
.\run.ps1 test

# Install dependencies
.\run.ps1 install
```

### Batch File

Use the `run.bat` script for simple commands:

```cmd
# Show all available commands
run.bat help

# Quick start
run.bat quick-start

# Run the GUI
run.bat gui

# Run the CLI
run.bat cli
```

### Available Commands

Both scripts support these commands:

- `help` - Show available commands
- `install` - Install dependencies
- `validate` - Validate project setup
- `quick-start` - Quick start with validation
- `test` - Run all tests
- `cli` - Run CLI interface
- `gui` - Run GUI interface
- `clean` - Clean up temporary files
- `check` - Run all checks (install, validate, test)

## Usage

### Multi-Vault Mode

The application now uses a multi-vault system by default, allowing you to create and manage multiple disconnected vaults:

#### Using CLI

```bash
# Create a new vault
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli create-vault --name "Personal" --master-password "your_password"

# List all vaults
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli list-vaults

# Open a vault
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli open-vault --name "Personal" --master-password "your_password"

# Add an entry to the current vault
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli add --service "Gmail" --username "user@gmail.com" --password "password123"

# List entries in current vault
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli list-entries

# Close the current vault
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli close-vault

# Delete a vault
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli delete-vault --name "Personal"

# Rename a vault
python -m cli.multi_vault_cli rename-vault --old-name "Personal" --new-name "Work"
```

#### Using GUI

1. **Start the GUI**: `python -m gui.app` or `.\run.ps1 gui`
2. **Create vaults** using the "Create Vault" button
3. **Select and open vaults** by double-clicking or using "Open Vault"
4. **Manage entries** within each vault independently
5. **Switch between vaults** by closing one and opening another

#### Multi-Vault Features

- **Vault Isolation**: Each vault is completely separate and encrypted independently
- **Vault Management**: Create, rename, delete, backup, and restore vaults
- **Entry Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search entries within each vault
- **Vault Registry**: Automatic tracking of all vaults with metadata
- **Secure Storage**: Each vault is stored as a separate encrypted database file

### Security Best Practices

- Use a strong, unique master password
- Enable two-factor authentication where possible
- Regularly backup your vault
- Keep your master password secure and separate from your vault
- Use the password generator for unique, strong passwords

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_crypto.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=pm_core
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Linting
python -m flake8 pm_core/ cli/ gui/ tests/

# Code formatting
python -m black pm_core/ cli/ gui/ tests/
```

## Architecture

The project is organized into several modules:

- **`pm_core/`** - Core password manager functionality
  - `crypto.py` - Encryption and key derivation
  - `models.py` - Data models and structures
  - `storage.py` - Vault storage and persistence
  - `manager.py` - Main password manager logic
  - `vault_manager.py` - Multi-vault management
  - `utils.py` - Utility functions
  - `exceptions.py` - Custom exceptions

- **`cli/`** - Command-line interface
- **`gui/`** - Graphical user interface
- **`tests/`** - Test suite
- **`scripts/`** - Utility scripts

## Security

This password manager implements several security measures:

- **Argon2** for key derivation (memory-hard, resistant to GPU attacks)
- **AES-256** for data encryption
- **Secure memory wiping** to prevent password recovery from RAM
- **Password strength validation** to ensure strong passwords
- **Secure clipboard handling** with automatic clearing
